Week 2 SD015 Assignment - Image Gallery with Accessible Features

Reflection:

Requirements achieved & not achieved:
The webpage displays well and you are able to move from one picture to another using a mouse. I've not been able to work out how to do this using the left and right arrow keys and have left some code in that does not work.
The pictures do no squash on smaller screens and the gallery boxes reformat neatly.
Accessibility measures that do work are alt and pointer change.

Further reflections:
For the amount of time I've spent on this, it looks good, but without the left and right tab, or at one time my attempt to put a blue border around the image its lacking all the pieces needed.

I'd appreciate some help with understanding why it hasn't worked.

I googled, revisited the workshop recording and worked with fellow students on Friday. I also put my code into ChatGPT for help but it either wasn't useful or I didn't understand what it meant.

Feedback welcome as always. Enjoy the peaceful pictures.
